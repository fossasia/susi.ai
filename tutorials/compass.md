# Compass

## What is a Compass?
A compass is an instrument used for navigation and orientation that shows direction relative to the geographic cardinal directions. Usually, a diagram called a compass rose shows the directions north, south, east, and west on the compass face as abbreviated initials.

## EXPERIMENT FOR PSLAB COMPASS

### Goal of the experiment 
To determine the direction of a place using PSLab app.

### Materials required
* Android Phone
* [PSLab Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.pslab&hl=en_US)

#### Procedure
* Open PSLab Android app

         <td><img src="/_static/img_compass_1.PNG"></td>
     </tr>
 </table>

* Select the compass option
* Once the compass opens start rotating the phone 360 degrees in order to calibrate the compass.
* Now, rotate your phone in any cardinal direction.

### Observation

* On rotating the phone from one direction to another, the Compass will start rotating denoting the particular direction (N,S,E & W or Subcardinal directions).
* Alternatively , you may also select the  axes parallel to the ground like **X axis , Y axis or Z axis**.
* You may even record the interaction using the in-built record option present in the top right corner of the Compass.
* To view the recorded interactions, you just have to go to the **Logged Data** option present in the menu bar.

### Conclusion

I hereby conclude that PSLab android app can be used to determine the direction of a place.

## EXPERIMENT 2

a) I proposed an experiment to find how mobile compasses work without actually using magnets within the phone.

b) Observations :
1) For the given experiment we need a coiled wire connected to a battery. In case of a battery turn the switch on so that current starts flowing through the circuit.
2) Now on placing the PSLab compass near the coiled wire we notice no deflection in the compass. But on taking a normal magnetic compass we do see deflection.
3) As we shift the normal magnetic compass around the coiled wire the compass deflects in a different manner. But this shows no effect on the PSLab compass.
4) Thus through this experiment it shows that flowing charges (current) do produce a magnetic field which do interact with the magnet inside a normal but that show no effect on the PSLab compass.

c) Conclusion :

5) This thus shows that the PSLab compass does not use magnets but in turn uses GPS and other sensors (basically digital means) to provide direction in terms of North,South,East and West. It further analyses the GPS and Sensor readings and then using this information aligns the compass needles according to our phones alignment and general position.
6) This is also one of the better (and probably only way) ways to integrate a compass in a digital device as an actual compass may hinder with the phone other electrical components causing them to malfunction.

d) Screenshots provided below :

1)Without Current:

2)With Current:

e) As you can see there is no deflection caused by the flow of charges in the circuit, i.e, the induced magnetic field does interact with the PSLab compass.
