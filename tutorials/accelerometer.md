# Accelerometer


## What is an Accelerometer
Accelerometer is used to measure acceleration of a body along the X, Y and Z axis.

## Experiment for Accelerometer

### Learning Objectives
To find the acceleration of a body along different axises 
### Material Required
* Android Phone
* [PSLab Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.pslab&hl=en_US)

### Procedure
* Open PSLab Android App
* Scroll down to the **accelerometer**

* You will see three graphs for x-axis, y-axis and z-axis
* Move your device along x-axis, y-axis and z-axis

### Observation

* You will see the acceleration of all the axis
* Acceleration is represented in numerical form as well as in graph
