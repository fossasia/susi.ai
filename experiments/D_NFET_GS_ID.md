## Dependence of drain current on G-S voltage, and Source Voltage

![](images/schematics/njfet.svg)

* Set the source voltage for various values between 2, and 5 , and obtain the characteristic curves
* Gate Voltage(PV2) is varied in steps, and for each step the drain current is calculated from the difference between voltages at PV1 and CH1, and the known value of the resistor(560R)
* Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.
